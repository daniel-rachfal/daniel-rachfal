### Hi, I'm Dan!

I'm a Software Developer freshly graduated from Northumbria University ðŸ˜…

I enjoy [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel), dabble in Python and mess around with web frameworks ðŸ«  (Shoutout to [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro))

I'm working on releasing some of my work on public repositories (*after refractoring*), so hopefully the green activity squares stonks go up ðŸ“ˆ
